            I would like to thank everyone who has given their time to explore this website. 
            I hope that all of you found this intersting. 
            This website was made in honor for the great battle ship of the Kreigsmarine KMS Biskmarck. 
            It was truly an astounding ship for it's time.
            The site's creator, Jaime III O. Icayan, has deep respect to the ship.
